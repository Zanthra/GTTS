Version 1.3.3 2018-06-10
------------------------

This version removes the welcome window due to various potential
issues I don't feel confident in my ability to track down and fix.

It also adds a Safe Mode checkbox that disables all runtime events
meaning that the player must adjust the game speed and hand
crafting rates manually. It also disables all runtime mod settings
changes. This can substantially improve the mdos compatibility
in multiplayer or in concjunction with other mods.

Version 1.3.2 2018-01-31
------------------------

Changed the welcome popup to not appear on tick 1 of the
game so as not to interfere with the game tips that prevents
interaction with the UI.

Version 1.3.1 2018-01-31
------------------------

Fixed the check for the setting used to disasble the welcome
message so that it actually disables the welcome message.

Added an option to close the notification permanenetly for a
save game on the dialog itself so players can supress the
welcome message if it appears too frequently.

Also nil the UI event handler to clean up resources.

Version 1.3.0 2018-01-31
------------------------

Fixed character movement animation, and player mining speed,
along with addition and reorganization of many of the adjusted.
speeds, and the addition of a couple of durations specific to
the new artillery cannon and artillery wagon.

This release introduces a welcome message to help people
set up the mod, and changes the default to a neutral 60 FPS.
The notification can be disabled in the mod options.


Version 1.2.0 2017-07-25
------------------------

Added per map options for adjusting values for pollution
enemy expansions, evolution, and hand crafting rates.

Changed train properties to more accurately adjust their
acceleration and collision damage.


Version 1.1.2 2017-07-25
------------------------

Added the following properties to be adjusted as power
rates used by roboports, solar panels, combinators,
and the rocket silo.

charging_energy
production
idle_energy_usage
lamp_energy_usage
active_energy_usage


Version 1.1.1 2017-07-24
------------------------

Made adjustments to the "heat_buffer" "max_trasfer"
property of nuclear reactors and heat pipes.


Version 1.1.0 2017-07-17
------------------------

Fixed the events related to changing the game speed
so that it properly updates the game speed when and
only when the mod settings have changed or the mod
or game is updated.

No longer adjusts the values of

request_to_open_door_timeout
flow_length_in_ticks

Due to problems at low target frame rates and the
minor ingame impact of these values.


Version 1.0.1 2017-07-16
------------------------

Small changes to readme, and removed nonfunctioning
option to immediately reset the game speed of a
running game.


Version 1.0.0 2017-07-16
------------------------

This mod now also adjusts the object weights and the
energy per hit point of collision damage in order to
properly adjust the kinetic energy of vehicles.

The mod also now adjusts mining and repair tool
durability which was based on ticks used.


Version 0.2.1 2017-07-01
------------------------

Excluded "god-controller" from modified prototypes due
to minimum speed issues causing error loading into
Factorio version 0.15.26 .


Version 0.2.0 2017-06-28
------------------------

Added a load of missing modifications to time ratios, in
particular changed accumulator Input and Output rates,
and fixed vehicle power consumption.

Moved the modifications from data-updates to
data-final-fixes as some mods change crafting speeds
in their data-updates, such as Angel's modifications
to Bob's MK 2 Chemical Plants.

Added a wild guess fluid speed modification. Since the
math beind fluid speeds is pretty obscured, and I don't
have a good way of testing it, use at your own risk.


Version 0.1.1 2017-06-27
------------------------

First release to mod portal as mod is stable, and many
of the initial goals are accomplished.


Version 0.1.0 2017-06-25
----------------------

Created mod base and modified a collection of speeds.
